# MCP in Unsloth Studio

## Connect Blender MCP

Studio bundles the Blender MCP runtime, **disabled by default**. No server commands
or downloads are needed. The Blender add-on is installed separately.

1. Open **Manage MCP servers → Blender**, approve the execution warning and choose
   **Enable Blender MCP**. Use a tool-capable model with MCP enabled for the chat.
2. Open **Setup help → Download Blender add-on** for
   [Blender's official page](https://www.blender.org/lab/mcp-server/).
3. In Blender 5.1+, enable **Preferences → System → Network → Allow Online Access**.
   Drag the website's install button into Blender twice: first to add the Blender
   Lab repository, then to install MCP. Alternatively, search **MCP** in
   **Get Extensions** after adding the repository.
4. Enable and start the add-on bridge, keep Blender open, then **Test connection**.

A green dot means Blender is connected; amber means only the MCP server is connected.
Setup help stays in the same Blender entry. Advanced settings configure the bridge
port (default `9876`) and optional Blender executable. This port is not an HTTP URL.

The bridge uses loopback on the **Studio backend machine**, not a remote browser.
Studio does not install or launch Blender during setup. Approved tools can run
Python, write files and launch background Blender. Existing tool permissions apply;
external model providers receive tool results. Keep the unauthenticated bridge local.

The runtime excludes the large API/manual reference corpus and its three offline
documentation tools. Source and license details: `backend/vendor/blender_mcp/NOTICE.md`.

## Studio's own MCP server

Unsloth can expose a local MCP server so an MCP client can inspect models and
GPU state, validate recipes, start or stop training, inspect recipe output, and
export a loaded model.

The server is disabled by default. Enable it for a local Unsloth process with:

```bash
UNSLOTH_STUDIO_ENABLE_MCP=1 \
UNSLOTH_STUDIO_MCP_TOKEN='use-a-local-secret' \
unsloth studio
```

The endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8888/mcp/` when Unsloth uses its default port
(a request to `/mcp` redirects to the canonical `/mcp/`). Use the actual Unsloth
port when it is configured differently.

The high-impact tools are:

- `studio_status` and `list_local_models` for discovery
- `get_training_status`, `start_training`, `stop_training`, and `list_training_runs`
- `validate_recipe`, `get_recipe_job_status`, and `get_recipe_job_dataset`
- `load_checkpoint` and `export_gguf`

`start_training` accepts the same fields as the Unsloth `TrainingStartRequest`.
The request is validated by the existing Pydantic model before a subprocess is
started. Export paths use the existing Unsloth validation as well.

The endpoint always requires `UNSLOTH_STUDIO_MCP_TOKEN` and checks an exact
Bearer token for both HTTP and WebSocket connections. Keep it on localhost
unless the deployment has an authenticated reverse proxy. The MCP endpoint is
intentionally opt-in because tools can consume GPU memory, write model
artifacts, and stop active work.
